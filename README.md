I am a software developer currently pursuing my M1 and actively seeking a 3-4 month internship opportunity starting in early May.

Passionate about the world of computers. I see technology as science spoken into existence, and my mission as an engineer is to do the translation.
My primary expertise lies in developing mobile and web applications, with an interest in full-stack development.
I am proficient in creating efficient, user-friendly interfaces and writing clean, maintainable code.
I am eager to apply my skills in a practical setting and contribute to a dynamic team, while expanding my knowledge in full-stack technologies.
